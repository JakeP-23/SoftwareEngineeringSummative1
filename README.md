Software Engineering - Summative 1 Assignment

The product I chose to create for my employer was a trade eligibility trade checker. This app is mainly meant to be used by the reporters that send in the SMMD form to calculate whether the trades that they have booked with clients are eligible for SMMD reporting or not. This has been a recent issue with reporters, as some have not been reporting trades that should have been reported. Iâ€™ve decided to build this calculator to help identify trades that need to be reported, to ensure the accuracy of the data that we receive at the bank and to minimise reporter issues, therefore reducing the reporting burden on the reporter and us at the bank. 

I chose to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the very simple web application. I have kept the design extremely basic and simple as the functionality and purpose of the web app is not complicated and is trying to tackle a very simple issue. I have kept the app complying to the bank branding by using the colours to make it more professional looking. I also kept the code very simple and limited the user inputs to the minimum information needed to calculate whether a trade is eligible or not. This reduces the chance for errors when inputting data, and keeps the calculation for eligibility nice and simple and not too complex.  

To make sure that I capture all of the features properly and to make sure I could keep track of progress, I created a project in GitHub to track the project. I primarily used it to make sure I captured all of the functionality needed for the app to function properly. I used issues so I could keep track of the requirements for the project. This step was very important as if I did not capture all of the requirements, this could lead to the app not capturing the right data, and therefore potentially lead to misreporting from multiple, if not all, of the reporters. This would create a huge workload for the reporters to fix their misreporting and for us at the bank to fix the app and work with the reporters to correct the misreporting. These were the issues I captured below:

Because I used GitHub, I was able to link the issues to my project that I created in GitHub. I was also able to link my Kanban board that was created in GitHub, to track the progress of actually coding and developing the app itself. Please see below:
