Software Engineering - Summative 1 Assignment

The product I chose to create for my employer was a trade eligibility trade checker. This app is mainly meant to be used by the reporters that send in the SMMD form to calculate whether the trades that they have booked with clients are eligible for SMMD reporting or not. This has been a recent issue with reporters, as some have not been reporting trades that should have been reported. I’ve decided to build this calculator to help identify trades that need to be reported, to ensure the accuracy of the data that we receive at the bank and to minimise reporter issues, therefore reducing the reporting burden on the reporter and us at the bank. 

I chose to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the very simple web application. I have kept the design extremely basic and simple as the functionality and purpose of the web app is not complicated and is trying to tackle a very simple issue. I have kept the app complying to the bank branding by using the colours to make it more professional looking. I also kept the code very simple and limited the user inputs to the minimum information needed to calculate whether a trade is eligible or not. This reduces the chance for errors when inputting data, and keeps the calculation for eligibility nice and simple and not too complex.  

To make sure that I capture all of the features properly and to make sure I could keep track of progress, I created a project in GitHub to track the project. I primarily used it to make sure I captured all of the functionality needed for the app to function properly. I used issues so I could keep track of the requirements for the project. This step was very important as if I did not capture all of the requirements, this could lead to the app not capturing the right data, and therefore potentially lead to misreporting from multiple, if not all, of the reporters. This would create a huge workload for the reporters to fix their misreporting and for us at the bank to fix the app and work with the reporters to correct the misreporting. These were the issues I captured below:

Because I used GitHub, I was able to link the issues to my project that I created in GitHub. I was also able to link my Kanban board that was created in GitHub, to track the progress of actually coding and developing the app itself. Please see below:

This was a really useful way to know what stage of the project I was at really quickly. I think for larger scale projects involving multiple team members, this would be a really useful tool as you’re able to assign certain tasks to certain people, and very easily and quickly see what stage each task is in for each person. I decided not to use Jira and Confluence which is what we use in the workplace. This was because by using GitHub, everything I was working on and needed was in one place. Also, you are able to link your project to the specific repository that contains all of the code. I think this is a really useful feature, as even those that are not involved in the coding development side of a project, are able to see the progress being made, and by linking the issue tickets and kanban board all together in the project, it gives anyone looking at it a very in depth overview of how the whole project is progressing, and whether you can meet the deadline. I think by using GitHub it also encourages you to use an Agile approach, by having the tools so easily available and easy to link with each other. It allows someone to use the Agile approach very easily. Also, as this was a software development project, using the Agile method in my opinion is the most appropriate for a project like this, as you are able to create a minimum viable product very early on. This is very useful for both the development team and the end users of the product, as tweeks can be made throughout the project in different sprints, which would not have a big impact on the overall outcome of the project. In contrast, using the waterfall method, you would only produce the final product at the end of the project, which may not be exactly what the end user wanted. So, you would have to restart the project from the beginning to make any minor or major changes. 

To create the prototype, I used figma to make a prototype of what the web page would look like once you load it up including the button and user input. Please see below the screenshot of the prototype:

I wanted to keep the design very simple to not over complicate the app, and also to not include information from the reporter that did not need to be captured or go into the eligibility calculation, again to reduce the room for errors. Also keeping the prototype simple and basic gave me more time to develop and write the code for the app, instead of spending too much time designing a prototype that would turn out to be unachievable. To start building the prototype I started with just box outlines of where the user input boxes were going to be. This gave me the skeleton shape of the prototype. I then added the titles of the user input boxes, and what to input into the text boxes. I then added the button that would calculate whether the trade was eligible or not. To finish the prototype I added the bank colours and the logo to make it look more professional and closer to what the final product would actually look like. Once the prototype was finished, I went about starting the code. Again, the first bit of code I wrote was just the bare bones of the webpage. I did this to scope out the size of the page and where everything would fit onto the app page. I did not want to fill the page with input boxes that were not necessary or with branding images, as I think that would have made the app look too complicated and over engineered. The next step I took was to add the input boxes for the user to add the trade details needed for the calculation. These were just basic input boxes with no instructions in them and they had no titles. This gave me a good scope of where they could sit on the web page without looking too spaced apart. I then coded in the calculation for whether a trade is eligible or not, and attached the action to a button under the last input box. I then input specific values that I knew would give me a specific outcome to test whether the calculation and button actually worked and returned the correct output based on what I input. I had plans to add more inputs that the user could add, however I thought that this would over complicate the app and would increase the potential for inputting incorrect data and therefore affecting the calculation and potentially returning the incorrect result.  

I decided to keep the app web page based and not create a prototype for a mobile device. This is because a lot of the data that would be input into the calculator is market sensitive information, so having the app on a mobile device which is easily accessible anywhere, could lead to data privacy breaches and potentially data losses and leaks. By keeping it as a web page application, this could incentivise users to only use the web app on their work computer, or when they are working from home in a secure location with a secure connection. Therefore, majorly reducing the risk of a data loss or breach. This is why there is not a prototype for a mobile device. 

Overall, I think the design I have chosen might be a bit too simple. I think I could have potentially added a few more features for the user to input, however I would have balance this with whether the added information and features would actually be a benefit to the end user. I think the prototype I produced could have been more interactive for the users, which would have given the end user a more realistic example of what the web app would actually function like and look like. However, I think that the web app I have created definitely serves a purpose and simply completes a task that is not very complicated. I did not want to include too much branding on the webpage as I feel that would have cramped the webpage with useless information. I want to keep the app clean and concise. In terms of the coding development, I could have used different branches to test different layouts of the app without compromising the main branch. This would have given the end user options of which layout that would prefer and which one would be easier to use. This could have been beneficial as I could have created different prototype options to see which one the end user preferred as well. To conclude, I think the web app definitely for fills a purpose and is definitely beneficial to reporters that report SMMD (Sterling Money Market Data) as we have had some reporting issues recently, so having the app will help reporters understand if specific trades need to be include in the reporting form or not, which was the main purpose of the web app.
